Welcome the greatest game ever made, commonly known as
"Greatest America" a simulation of the promising utopia
we live in!

1.) Use your mouse and click within a cell anywhere on in the game to trigger an event

2.) what should happen when the event is triggered

When the event is trigger a HUGE Wall will be erected and all the dirty miners will be
rounded up and stored in the wall by Donald(originally called Jailer) and all of the
Ore Blobs will be turned into spinning gold bars by Melania(originally called Midas).
Finally when Greatest America is great again all of the gold will surround the Great Donald
and you will get a lovely quote from the Supreme President himself.

3.) what the affected entities should do

    * Miners- Will behave as normal miners, until they are met with the Great
        unstoppable force of Donald. Upon meeting his grace they will be
        promptly "poofed" into the HUGE wall he has erected and be stuck there
        until the world is great again.

    * Ore Blobs- Once the ore blobs are created they are swiftly tracked down
    and turned into gold by the Divine Queen of Gold herself, Melania. Once
    Melania's work has finished all of the Gold will naturally flow and surround
    the Supreme Overlord Donald.


4.) what the new entity is and how it should behave

    * Donald(Trump) - Will hunt down the dirty miners with amazing speed,
        teleportation and the vigor of a man with very large hands. He will
        "poof" the miners into the illustrious Wall he erected and continue his
        unrelenting hunt until he is finished.

    * Melania(Trump) - Will track down the Ore Blobs as they appear with the same
        over powered abilities as her husband, and Great Overlord. She will turn the
        Ore Blobs into beautiful bars of spinning gold, the blobs are enchanted with
        a greed spell that pulls them to Donald.

    * Wall - The Huge Wall will be erected in a square shape and will serve as an obstacle
        for all the dirty miners who attempt to escape. Within the walls all background tiles
        will be set to Mud and entities inside the Wall will be set to Captured and all obstacles
        will be removed.

    * Text - When the Simulation has completed and the Greatest America is Great Again
        the Text entity will be spawned and share the great message our Supreme Leader
        has to share!
